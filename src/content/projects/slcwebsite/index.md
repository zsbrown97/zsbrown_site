The [St. Louis County Website](https://stlouiscountymo.gov) is a deceptively large and intricate website. My main goals and contributions have been centered around streamlining navigation and general improvements to the UI/UX across the site.

## Public Notice Postings

One of my first significant contributions was the automatic posting of public notices. Originally, every public notice had to be manually created and populated with the appropriate information for the corresponding public notice. This is all despite all Public Notice information being present on another County website. I was able to automate this process (and in the process, cleared this portion of the web team's plate) by calling the API for the other site. Everything is dynamically shown in such a way that only the most immediate notices are shown, and disappear automatically after their dates have passed.
